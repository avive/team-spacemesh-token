# Team Spacemesh Token

## Installation

First ensure you are in a new and empty directory.

1. Install Truffle globally
    ```javascript
    npm install -g truffle
    yarn install
    ```

2. Run the development console
    ```javascript
    truffle develop
    ```

3. Compile and migrate the smart contracts. Note inside the development console we don't preface commands with `truffle`.
    ```javascript
    test
    compile
    migrate
    ```
